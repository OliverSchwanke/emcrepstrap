== M-Apps for EMC2 Based RepStrap ==

These Python apps provide the glue needed to execute RepRap G-Code in the EMC2 system.
They communicate with an Arduino running the RepRap Arduino Firmware G-Code Interpreter. However, the Arduino only controls the extruder and EMC2 manages the positioning. (That means you should only wire the Arduino to the extruder, not the steppers.)

The Codes:

M101 - Turn extruder on, forward 

M102 - Turn extruder on, reverse 

M103 - Turn extruder off 

M104 - Set extruder temp to P 

M105 - NoOp : Needed so the g code interpreter doesn't barf. 

M106 - Fan on 

M107 - Fan off 

M108 - set max extruder speed, in RPM to P

M109 - 
 

M110 - NoOp : Needed so the g code interpreter doesn't barf



Installation:

First, make sure pySerial (http://pyserial.sourceforge.net) is installed. Search for 'python-serial' in Synaptic on Ubuntu.

	NOTE: At the time of this writing (May 22, 2008) the "py25-serial" package provided by 
	MacPorts did not work. Installing directly from the source available on SourceForge did.

Second, copy all the M* files and RepRapArduinoSerialSender.py to the correct location. See: 

http://www.linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gcode_main.html#sec:M100-to-M199:

If you change the path value to something new you may wan to make sure the new path doesn't have spaces in it. I can't guaranty it's a problem, but I had bad luck otherwise.


Configuration:

Currently the only configuration to be done is to tell the code where the serial port is. Edit RepRapArduinoSerialSender.py and change the line:

	port = "/dev/tty.usbserial-FTDOMG4X"
